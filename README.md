# defuse-linux-dangerous-commands
A script to defuse dangerous commands from your bash history.

Sometimes you and your colleagues work on the same server at the same time. And because we all use the top key out of laziness to find previous commands, dangerous commands like reboot or clear a folder may be mistakenly selected and executed from the history list. Add keywords that are dangerous in commands to the input of this script and run this script in .bashrc to safely change this history for you.
